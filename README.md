# Yourls Popular Links

This version:
* is compatible with Yourls 1.7 or higher
* fixes the deprecated function and removes the warning
* formats the code to make it more consistent and prettier

The plugin shows an admin page with the most popular links created in the last 1, 30, 365, and 1000 days on a YOURLS site.

Download plugin.php, save it as plugin.php, and upload it to YOURLS_DIRECTORY/user/plugins/popular-links/

IMPORTANT:  Make sure to remove/overwrite any older version of Popular Links, if you've installed it on your server.

Advanced:

At the bottom of the plugin, you can edit the values, e.g.:

> show_top(1000,5);

* 1000 means the number of days you are selecting from the database
* 5 means the number of links it will show

** Bonus! Want to show it as a public page?

Save popularlinks.php to the YOURLS_DIRECTORY/pages directory of your Yourls installation
and access it like: YOURLS-SITE/popularlinks

As with the plugin, you can customize it by editing it's values.

Please let me know if there's anything else that needs to be fixed, changed, or updated.
